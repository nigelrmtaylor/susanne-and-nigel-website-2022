# Presents

It is traditional for guests to bring presents for the young bride and groom to help then set up their new home.

We are neither young nor setting up a new home so we really do not wish you to give presents. We know you will all have spent a lot getting and staying here and your presence is the biggest present you can give us.

Thank you.
