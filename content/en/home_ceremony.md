# Wedding Ceremony

11:30 - Marie de Monaco  
Monaco Ville  
Monaco

La Mairie de Monaco, Monaco's town hall is among the oldest institutions of the principality and has a beautiful wood-panelled registry office.

**However, due to the Covid restrictions still in place in Monaco, we are heavily restricted to the number of people who can attend the ceremony in person. We therefore intend to stream the event over the Internet so that everyone who is unable to attend in person can watch it with a glass at Castelroc prior to the Champagne reception.**

The bus from the hotel will take you up right to the bus terminal and from there you just need to walk 50m straight down the lane from where the bus will drop you off.
