# Accommodation

## Menton

We feel that the best options for accommodation are in [Menton](/en/menton)

Menton is a lovely little French town between Monaco and the Italian border. It has the additional advantage of not having to pay the Monaco premium.

We will be providing transport from Menton to the wedding ceremony on the Tock in Monaco, from there to Italy to our wedding party and back to Menton afterwards.

We have had a look around Menton and think these 3 hotels are in good locations and a range of prices.

- [Royal Westminster](https://www.hotel-royal-westminster.com/en/)
- [Ibis Styles](https://all.accor.com/hotel/7009/index.en.shtml)
- [Best Western HÃ´tel Mediteranee](https://www.hotel-med-menton.com/en/)

We have also checked on Booking.com and there are also a number of other hotels and holiday apartments available if you prefer. 

## Latte

The reception and party will be held at Villa Eva Beach in [Latte](/en/latte) which is a few minutes drive (bus or taxi) from Menton. Latte is nice and quiet but there is really very little to do there, so we do not advise staying there. We think Menton is a much better idea.

## Monaco

The wedding ceremony will be held in Monaco and Monaco is a good (if expensive) place to stay. On the whole, we think Menton is a better bet unless you really want to push the boat out.
