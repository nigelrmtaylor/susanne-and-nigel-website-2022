# Accommodation

## Menton

We feel that the best options for accommodation are in [Menton](/en/menton)

Menton is a lovely little French town between Monaco and the Italian border. It has the additional advantage of not having to pay the Monaco premium, so we decided to look for accommodation for all of us there.

We are looking into finding hotels for all budgets for Friday to Sunday to allow us all to meet for an informal dinner somewhere in Menton and a nice brunch on Sunday morning.

We will be providing transport from the hotels to the wedding ceremony on the rock, from there to Italy to our wedding party and back to the hotels afterwards.

We have had a look around Menton and think these 3 hotels are in good locations and a range of prices.

- [Royal Westminster](https://www.hotel-royal-westminster.com/en/)
- [Ibis Styles](https://all.accor.com/hotel/7009/index.en.shtml)
- [Best Western HÃ´tel Mediteranee](https://www.hotel-med-menton.com/en/)

We are currently speaking to the hotels to see what they can do in terms of group rates

## Latte

The reception and party will be held at Villa Eva Beach in [Latte](/en/latte) which is a few minutes drive (bus or taxi) from Menton. Latte is nice and quiet but there is really very little to do there so we do not advise staying there. We think Menton is a much better idea.

## Monaco

The wedding ceremony wil be held in Monaco and Monaco is a good (if expensive) place to stay. On the whole, we think Menton is a better bet unless you really want to push the boat out.
