# Wedding Events

The festivities will be spread over 2 days (Thursday 2nd June & Friday 3rd June) leaving the weekend free for you to explore the rest of the [Cote d'Azur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Riviera).

## Thursday

We think our guests will arrive for the wedding on Thursday and make their way to their accommodation. We have put together some [notes](/en/transport) on how best to get from the Airport to Menton for those who will be arriving by plane. As discussed here, [Menton](/en/menton) is a lovely place and well worth spending some time exploring.

On Thursday evening, we will host an informal 'Beer & Pizza' evening to give people time to get to know each other before the main events of Friday begin. This will be held in La Belle Escale, one of the restaurants by the port from 7:30 until 22:30.

## Friday

Friday is the main day when all being well, we become husband and wife.

As already mentioned [here](/en/transport), we will provide all the transport between the wedding locations in [Menton](/en/menton), [Monaco](/en/monaco) and [Latte](/en/latte).

On Friday morning, we will arrange a coach to pick you up from Menton and take you to [Monaco](/en/monaco) where the Ceremony and Champagne Reception will take place. The exact location where the coach will pick you up is yet to be confirmed but will be somewhere near the center of Menton and the hotels we listed [here](/en/accommodation).

The journey from Menton to Monaco Ville on [Le Rocher](https://www.visitmonaco.com/en/routes-and-walks/402/le-rocher) will take around 45 minutes.

After the Ceremony has concluded, we will all walk through the old town of Monaco to [CastelRoc](https://www.castelrocmonaco.com/) for a glass of champagne and some canapes.

At around 14:30, we will walk back to the Coach for the trip to the Reception at [Villa Eva Beach ](https://www.villaevabeach.com/en) in [Latte](/en/latte).

Upon arrival at Villa Eva Beach at around 16:00, we will be welcomed with Prosecco and a great Italian aperitivo buffet to be followed by dinner.

We will arrange busses from Villa Eva Beach to Menton & Monaco at the end of the evening (Around midnight).
