## If you are arriving by plane

Nice Côte d'Azur (NCE) is the closest airport to Monaco and Menton, only about half an hour's drive away from Monaco, a bit longer to Menton. If you want to rent a car for a longer stay, there are a number of rental companies directly at the airport.

There is also a regular bus service going to Monaco and Menton, the 110. At the moment it costs 22€ one way, 33€ return trip per person and the bus will drop you about 5 Minutes away from the hotels (bus stop: Casino Menton).

Try to avoid the taxis, they cost an arm and a leg!

## If you are arriving by car

Both Monaco and Menton are easily reachable via the A8 motorway with dedicated exits. Most hotels that we found also provide garages for cars, but you should let us know early on, if you require one, so we can reserve a spot for you.

## Transportation on the wedding day

If you intend to come to the wedding ceremony with your own car, be aware that there is no possibility for parking up on the Rock, the closest parking is the Parking du Chemin des Pêcheurs directly below the Oceanographic Museum. The parking has a lift up to the Rock and you'll find yourself just a few minutes walk away from the Mairie.

If you coming with public transport, the terminus of Monaco buses nr 1 and 2 is up at the Rock, just a few minutes walk away from the Mairie.

We are organising buses from the hotels to the wedding ceremony from the ceremony and then back to the reception and party. Shuttle buses will also be provided to take you back to the hotels after the party.
