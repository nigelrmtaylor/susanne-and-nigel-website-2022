# Accommodation - English

We feel that the best options for accommodation are in Menton

Menton is a lovely little French town between Monaco and the Italian border. It has the additional advantage of not having to pay the Monaco premium, so we decided to look for accommodation for all of us there.

We are looking into finding hotels for all budgets for Friday to Sunday to allow us all to meet for an informal dinner somewhere in Menton and a nice brunch on Sunday morning.

We will be provinding transport from the hotels to the wedding ceremony on the rock, from there to Italy to our wedding party and back to the hotels afterwards.
