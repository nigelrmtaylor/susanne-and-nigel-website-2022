# Accommodation

We feel that the best options for accommodation are in Menton, and we suggest as a friendly reminder to book your hotel as soon as possible. Menton is quite popular and prices are going up with people starting to book their summer holidays now.

Menton is a lovely little French town between Monaco and the Italian border. It has the additional advantage of not having to pay the Monaco premium.

We will be providing transport from Menton to the wedding ceremony on the Rock in Monaco, from there to Italy to our wedding party and back to Menton afterwards.
