# Transport

We will take care of all the transport on the day of the wedding (Friday) between where we expect people to stay in [Menton](/en/menton), the wedding ceremony in [Monaco](/en/monaco) and the Reception in [Latte](/en/latte). Don't worry about the logistics, that is our problem.

You will need to get yourselves to [Menton](/en/menton) on Thursday in time for the 'Beer & Pizza' evening (20:00 ish) and away from there on afterwards.

This map shows the two main routes between the Airport and Menton. One is quick and dull via the A8 Autoroute whereas the other is pretty but slower via the coast road (Bas Corniche)

## If you are arriving by plane

If you are flying into the airport, and heading to Menton, there are a few ways to get there:

- Airport Bus
- Train
- Taxi
- Hire Car

[Here](nice.aeroport.fr/en/directions/public-transport) is the page on the airport website that explains things.

### Airport Bus

The 110 Airport bus is the easiest way to get from the airport to Menton or Monaco because it will pick yu up directly from the terminal and take you straight into the middle of Menton or Monaco. [Here](https://storage.googleapis.com/is-wp-22-prod/uploads-prod/2019/11/ZOU06_PLAN_DES_LIGNES_ALPES_MARITIMES-2-1.pdf) is a route map, [Here](https://storage.googleapis.com/is-wp-22-prod/uploads-prod/2021/08/ZOU06_TARIF_AEROPORT_LIGNES_110_210_250_07_2021.pdf) is a price list and [Here](https://storage.googleapis.com/is-wp-22-prod/uploads-prod/2021/04/ZOU06_Ligne110_AEROPORT_MONACO_MENTON_valable_%C3%A0_compter_du_26_-avril_-2021.pdf) is a timetable. The 110 takes the fastest route along the A8 Autoroute and then heads down into Monaco and then along the coast to Menton.

It is our favorite way of getting to and from the Airport and costs 33 EUR return. You can buy your tickets from the driver or in the terminal

### Train

The train is a fairly good option of getting from the Airport to Monaco or Menton. The disadvantage is that you need to take a tram (free) from the Terminal to the station (Nice St Augustin) [Here](https://www.lignesdazur.com/horaires-ligne/115) is a plan. You need to get off at the Grand Arénas stop and then walk along to Nice St Augustin. At the station, there is a ticket machine at the station. It's a bit messay but it works.

Once on the train, you get a beautiful journey between Nice & Monaco where the train hugs the coast and provides some lovely views. Just make sure you are on the coast side of the train.

[Here](https://en.oui.sncf/en/train/timetables/nice/menton) is a timetable. A One-way ticket from Nice St Augustin to Menton costs 6.60 EUR.

### Taxi

There are plenty of taxis at Nice airport and if there are a few of you, this can work out to be a good option. The fixd fares are listed [here](https://www.nice.aeroport.fr/en/directions/taxis) with the price being 95 - 125 EUR to Menton. As you ay have seen, we have created a Whatsapp group that may be a good way of finding others to share a taxi with.

### Hire Car

Nice Airport has the usual hire car companies and if you are staying a few days longer, the may be good idea. It will give you flexibility but you will need to pay for parking. Also, you need to be aware that the autoroutes in france are toll roads and these can easily add up. For example the toll from Nice to Monaco is something like 10 EUR.

### Others

There are a few other options that we would not reccommend:

- Helecopter to Monaco - Quick but expensive
- 100 Bus to Menton - Cheap but very slow

## If you are arriving by car

Both Monaco and Menton are easily reachable via the A8 motorway with dedicated exits. Most hotels that we found also provide garages for cars, but you should let the hotel know early on, if you require one, so they can reserve a spot for you.

Bear in mind that the Autoroutes in france charge a toll (Paege) and from the Airport to Monaco is around 10EUR. You can psy by credit card or cash.

## Transportation on the wedding day

If you intend to come to the wedding ceremony with your own car, be aware that there is no possibility for parking up on the Rock, the closest parking is the Parking du Chemin des Pêcheurs directly below the Oceanographic Museum. The parking has a lift up to the Rock and you'll find yourself just a few minutes walk away from the Mairie.

If you coming with public transport, the terminus of Monaco buses nr 1 and 2 is up at the Rock, just a few minutes walk away from the Mairie.

We are organising buses from the hotels to the wedding ceremony from the ceremony and then back to the reception and party. Shuttle buses will also be provided to take you back to the hotels after the party.
