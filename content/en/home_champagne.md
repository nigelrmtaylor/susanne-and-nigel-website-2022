# Champagne Reception

12:30 - 14:30 Castelroc  
Place de Palais  
Monaco Ville  
Monaco

The location for the Champagne reception is only a few minutes away on foot, so after the wedding ceremony we will walk together to Castelroc, right opposite the castle, where we will be received with champagne and other drinks and some nibbles.

We have enough time there to walk around and do some quick sight-seeing on the palace square and the park before we will take the bus to the Villa Eva Beach.
