# Wedding Events

The festivities will be spread over 2 days (Thursday 2nd June & Friday 3rd June) leaving the weekend free fo you to explore the rest of the [Cote d'Azur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Riviera).

## Thursday

We expect that our guests will arrive for the wedding on Thursday and make their way to their accommodation. We have put together some [notes](/en/transport) on how best to get from the Airport to Menton. As discussed here, [Menton](/en/menton) is a lovely place and well worth spending some time exploring.

On Thursday evening, we will host an informal 'Beer & Pizza' evening to give people time to get to know each other before the main events of Friday begin. This will likely be held in one of the [restaurants by the port](https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1wow9OD6sphe7DFiSzH8Cu2olGf7uTnwZ&usp=sharing)

## Friday

Friday is the main day when all being well, we well become man and wife.

As discussed [here](/en/transport), we will provide transport between [Menton](/en/menton) and [Monaco](/en/monaco) where the [Ceremony](/en/ceremony) and [Champagne Reception](/en/champagne) will take place. The exact location where the coach will pick up is yet to be confirmed but wil be somewhere near [here](https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1wow9OD6sphe7DFiSzH8Cu2olGf7uTnwZ&usp=sharing)

The Journey from Menton to the 'The Rock' (Monaco Ville) on [Le Rocher](https://www.visitmonaco.com/en/routes-and-walks/402/le-rocher) will take around 45 minutes.

When we arrive on at the rock, the coach will drop everyone off at the Parking by the [Ocenographique](https://musee.oceano.org/en/) and it is a 5 minute walk to the [Marie](https://www.mairie.mc/) where the wedding ceremony will take place. The ceremony will take around 30 minutes.

At around 14:30, we will walk back to the Coach for the trip to the Reception at [Villa Eva Beach ](https://www.villaevabeach.com/en) in [Latte](/en/latte)
