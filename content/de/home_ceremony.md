# Wedding Ceremony

Monaco Ville  
Monaco

La Mairie de Monaco, Monaco's town hall is among the oldest insitutions of the principality and has a beautiful wood-panelled registry office.

The bus from the hotel will take you up right to the bus terminal and from there you just need to walk 50m straight down the lane from where the bus will drop you off.
